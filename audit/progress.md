## Phase Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Meaningful Naming & Single Responsibility
#### Implementation Plan
1. Create the new utility modules and classes first
2. Gradually refactor the GmailClient class to use these new components
3. Update all references to the refactored components
4. Add comprehensive tests for the new modular structure

#### Testing Strategy
- For each refactored component, create dedicated unit tests
- Ensure test coverage remains above 80%
- Create integration tests that verify the components work together correctly
- Implement regression tests to confirm functionality hasn't changed

#### Implementation Summary
- ✅ Created utility modules for text processing and token management
- ✅ Refactored GmailClient into smaller components with clear responsibilities:
  - `GmailApiClient`: For raw API interactions
  - `EmailNormalizer`: For converting Gmail format to internal format
  - `EmailContentExtractor`: For handling email content and attachments
  - Kept GmailClient as a facade coordinating these components
- ✅ Moved token management to a dedicated TokenManager class
- ✅ Improved method naming consistency across all components
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage added for all refactored components

### Phase 2: DRY & KISS Principles
#### Implementation Plan
1. Create the retry decorator first and apply it to all API calls
2. Refactor token handling in AuthClient to remove duplication
3. Simplify the email querying logic with clearer, more focused methods
4. Implement Redis operation helpers for SyncStateManager

#### Testing Strategy
- Create parameterized tests for the retry decorator with different scenarios
- Test token handling with various edge cases (expiry, missing fields)
- Verify that simplified email querying logic maintains functionality
- Ensure Redis operations work properly with the new helper functions

#### Implementation Summary
- ✅ Created a reusable retry decorator in `shared/utils/retry.py` that handles API rate limiting consistently
  - Added comprehensive test suite for the decorator
  - Applied the decorator to all Gmail API methods
- ✅ Improved the AuthClient with helper methods for token parsing and caching
  - Created `_fetch_and_cache_token` to centralize token retrieval and caching logic
  - Reduced duplication between `get_user_token` and `refresh_token` methods
- ✅ Simplified email querying logic in GmailClient
  - Extracted a common `_fetch_emails_with_query` helper to reduce duplication
  - Streamlined query construction for better readability
  - Removed complex conditional logic and replaced with simpler, more linear flow
- ✅ Enhanced SyncStateManager with Redis operation helpers
  - Added a `_redis_operation` helper to standardize error handling
  - Created an async property for Redis client access that ensures initialization
  - Simplified all methods by removing duplicate initialization checks and error handling
  - Added named constants for clearer code instead of magic numbers
- ✅ All changes verified with no syntax or type errors found

### Phase 3: SOLID Principles
#### Implementation Plan
1. Define interfaces for email fetching and processing
2. Implement concrete strategies for adaptive polling
3. Refactor existing components to depend on interfaces
4. Update dependency injection in the main service

#### Testing Strategy
- Test implementations against their interfaces
- Create mock implementations for testing
- Verify that different strategies can be easily swapped
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing services

#### Implementation Summary
- ✅ Defined interfaces for core email service responsibilities:
  - `IEmailFetcher` in `interfaces/email_fetcher.py`
  - `IEmailNormalizer` and `IContentExtractor` in `interfaces/email_processor.py`
- ✅ Implemented the Strategy pattern for polling interval calculation:
  - Defined `PollingStrategy` interface in `strategies/polling_strategies.py`
  - Created concrete strategies: `FixedPollingStrategy` and `AdaptivePollingStrategy`.
- ✅ Refactored existing components to implement/depend on interfaces (Dependency Inversion):
  - `GmailApiClient` now implements `IEmailFetcher`.
  - `EmailNormalizer` now implements `IEmailNormalizer` and depends on `IContentExtractor`.
  - `EmailContentExtractor` now implements `IContentExtractor`.
  - `SyncStateManager` now depends on the `PollingStrategy` interface.
- ✅ Verified changes by running the full test suite (`pytest .`), all 113 tests passed.

### Phase 4: Encapsulation & Side Effects
#### Implementation Plan
1. Refactor Redis client access to be private
2. Rename methods to clearly indicate state changes
3. Split methods with side effects into pure and side-effect versions
4. Review public API surface and make appropriate methods private

#### Testing Strategy
- Verify that public API changes don't break existing functionality
- Test that side effects are properly isolated
- Ensure encapsulation improvements don't impact performance

### Phase 5: Error Handling & Validation
#### Implementation Plan
1. Create custom exception hierarchy
2. Implement input validation helpers
3. Standardize error handling across all components
4. Replace silent failures with proper error propagation

#### Testing Strategy
- Test that invalid inputs are properly rejected
- Verify that errors are properly propagated and can be caught
- Ensure all error scenarios are properly tested

### Phase 6: Readability & Formatting
#### Implementation Plan
1. Identify and refactor long methods
2. Reorganize method ordering for better readability
3. Replace magic numbers with named constants
4. Apply consistent formatting and documentation

#### Testing Strategy
- Ensure refactored code maintains test coverage
- Verify that performance is not negatively impacted
- Conduct code reviews focused on readability improvements

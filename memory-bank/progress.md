## Learning & Insights
- Microservices boundaries require careful consideration to avoid coupling
- TDD approach will help ensure clean interfaces between services
- Mock services for Gmail API and OpenAI will be essential for testing
- Docker Compose simplifies local development of multiple services
- Correlation IDs will be needed for request tracing across services
- Docker containerization requires careful consideration of build context for modules shared between services
- OAuth 2.0 flow requires proper state parameter handling for security and user tracking
- Rebuilding Docker containers is necessary after code changes rather than just restarting them
- Rate limiting is critical for Gmail API integration to avoid quota depletion
- Adaptive polling can optimize resource usage based on email volume patterns
- Resumable operations are essential for handling interruptions in email processing
- **Gmail API requires using "me" as the userId for authenticated user operations**
- **Internal user IDs should only be used for token retrieval, not for external API calls**
- **Inter-service authentication is working well with token retrieval mechanism**
- **The separation of authentication and resource services provides clean architecture boundaries**
- **Email content extraction requires careful handling of different MIME types**
- **HTML to text conversion needs to preserve important formatting while removing unnecessary markup**
- **Batch processing with proper rate limiting is essential for Gmail API quota management**
- **Properly structured test fixtures significantly improve test maintainability**
- **Integration tests bridge the gap between unit tests and end-to-end tests**
- **Performance testing is crucial for services handling large data volumes**
- **Mocking external dependencies is essential for reliable and fast tests**
- **Using parametrized tests in pytest reduces code duplication in test cases**
- **Separating test types (unit, integration, performance) improves test organization**
- **The Single Responsibility Principle significantly improves code maintainability and testability**
- **Breaking down large classes into smaller, focused components makes the codebase more understandable**
- **Extracting reusable utility functions increases code reuse across the application**
- **Clear and consistent naming conventions reduce cognitive load when reading code**
- **Method names that include units (e.g., _minutes) provide better API clarity**
- **Focusing each class on a single responsibility makes unit testing easier and more effective**
- **The facade pattern works well for coordinating multiple specialized components**
- **Separation of concerns improves future extensibility of the system**
- **Component-based architecture makes it easier to replace or upgrade individual parts**
- **TDD approach for refactoring ensures that functionality is preserved**

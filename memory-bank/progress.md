  - Added comprehensive error handling with retries and backoff
  - Set up RabbitMQ integration for message publishing

## In Progress
- Enhancing Email Ingestion Service with additional features:
  - Full adaptive polling implementation based on email volume
  - Advanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Performance optimization for large email volumes
- Setting up project structure for remaining microservices
- Creating test frameworks and CI pipeline
- Preparing Docker Compose configuration for local development

## Pending Tasks
- Completing full Email Ingestion Service implementation:
  - Add comprehensive test coverage
  - Implement monitoring and metrics
  - Add detailed logging and tracing
  - Optimize batch processing for large email volumes
- Building Classification Service
- Creating Response Generation Service (AI integration)
- Implementing Draft Management Service
- Setting up API Gateway
- Configuring message queues for inter-service communication

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1** (Completed): Project setup and Auth Service
   - Microservices structure setup
   - TDD framework configuration
   - Auth Service with OAuth 2.0 implementation
   - CI/CD pipeline setup with GitHub Actions

2. **Phase 2** (In Progress, Weeks 3-4): Email processing microservices
   - Email Ingestion Service implementation (core functionality completed)
   - Classification Service development
   - Service communication via RabbitMQ

3. **Phase 3** (Weeks 5-6): Response generation and draft management
   - Response Generation Service with AI integration
   - Draft Management Service
   - Integration testing between services

4. **Phase 4** (Weeks 7-8): Integration and API Gateway
   - API Gateway implementation
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation finalization

## TDD Progress
- Defined testing strategy for each microservice
- Created example test cases for core functionality
- Established mocking approach for external dependencies
- Planned test coverage requirements
- Successfully implemented and validated Auth Service tests
- Created initial Email Service tests for rate limiting and Gmail client
- Need to add comprehensive tests for Email Ingestion Service

## Known Issues
- None at this stage (successfully resolved Gmail API userId issue)

## Learning & Insights
- Microservices boundaries require careful consideration to avoid coupling
- TDD approach will help ensure clean interfaces between services
- Mock services for Gmail API and OpenAI will be essential for testing
- Docker Compose simplifies local development of multiple services
- Correlation IDs will be needed for request tracing across services
- Docker containerization requires careful consideration of build context for modules shared between services
- OAuth 2.0 flow requires proper state parameter handling for security and user tracking
- Rebuilding Docker containers is necessary after code changes rather than just restarting them
- Rate limiting is critical for Gmail API integration to avoid quota depletion
- Adaptive polling can optimize resource usage based on email volume patterns
- Resumable operations are essential for handling interruptions in email processing
- **Gmail API requires using "me" as the userId for authenticated user operations**
- **Internal user IDs should only be used for token retrieval, not for external API calls**
- **Inter-service authentication is working well with token retrieval mechanism**
- **The separation of authentication and resource services provides clean architecture boundaries**
- **Email content extraction requires careful handling of different MIME types**
- **HTML to text conversion needs to preserve important formatting while removing unnecessary markup**
- **Batch processing with proper rate limiting is essential for Gmail API quota management**

## Next Milestones
- Complete Email Ingestion Service testing:
  - Add unit tests for all components
  - Implement integration tests
  - Add performance tests for large email volumes
- Begin implementation of Classification Service with TDD approach
- Create initial tests for email classification functionality
- Implement rule-based classification engine

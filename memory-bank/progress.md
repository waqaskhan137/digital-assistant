## TDD Progress
- Defined testing strategy for each microservice
- Created example test cases for core functionality
- Established mocking approach for external dependencies
- Planned test coverage requirements
- Successfully implemented and validated Auth Service tests
- ⚠️ Partially completed tests for Email Ingestion Service:
  - ✅ Unit tests for some components (GmailClient, Rate Limiter)
  - ❌ Missing unit tests for other components (RabbitMQ client, SyncState manager, etc.)
  - ❌ Missing integration tests for service interactions
  - ❌ Missing performance tests for large email volumes
  - Current test coverage below target of 80%
- Creating initial tests for Classification Service

## Known Issues
- Email Ingestion Service lacks comprehensive testing (integration and performance tests are missing)
- Test coverage for Email Ingestion Service is below the target of 80%

## Learning & Insights
- Microservices boundaries require careful consideration to avoid coupling
- TDD approach will help ensure clean interfaces between services
- Mock services for Gmail API and OpenAI will be essential for testing
- Docker Compose simplifies local development of multiple services
- Correlation IDs will be needed for request tracing across services
- Docker containerization requires careful consideration of build context for modules shared between services
- OAuth 2.0 flow requires proper state parameter handling for security and user tracking
- Rebuilding Docker containers is necessary after code changes rather than just restarting them
- Rate limiting is critical for Gmail API integration to avoid quota depletion
- Adaptive polling can optimize resource usage based on email volume patterns
- Resumable operations are essential for handling interruptions in email processing
- **Gmail API requires using "me" as the userId for authenticated user operations**
- **Internal user IDs should only be used for token retrieval, not for external API calls**
- **Inter-service authentication is working well with token retrieval mechanism**
- **The separation of authentication and resource services provides clean architecture boundaries**
- **Email content extraction requires careful handling of different MIME types**
- **HTML to text conversion needs to preserve important formatting while removing unnecessary markup**
- **Batch processing with proper rate limiting is essential for Gmail API quota management**
- **Properly structured test fixtures significantly improve test maintainability**
- **Integration tests bridge the gap between unit tests and end-to-end tests**
- **Performance testing is crucial for services handling large data volumes**
- **Mocking external dependencies is essential for reliable and fast tests**
- **Using parametrized tests in pytest reduces code duplication in test cases**
- **Separating test types (unit, integration, performance) improves test organization**

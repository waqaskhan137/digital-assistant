# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have just completed Phase 3 of our code refactoring initiative, focusing on SOLID principles. The primary goal was to improve the design of the Email Service by introducing interfaces and applying dependency inversion and the strategy pattern.

The audit categorized issues according to fundamental software engineering principles:
- Meaningful Naming
- Single Responsibility & Modularity
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- SOLID Principles
- Encapsulation & Information Hiding
- Side-Effect Analysis
- Error Handling & Validation
- Readability & Formatting

We've successfully completed Phases 1, 2, and 3, significantly improving the Email Service structure.

## Recent Changes

### Phase 1: Single Responsibility & Meaningful Naming
- Refactored GmailClient into smaller, focused classes:
  - GmailApiClient: For raw API interactions
  - EmailNormalizer: For converting Gmail format to internal format
  - EmailContentExtractor: For handling MIME content, attachments, etc.
  - GmailClient now serves as a facade coordinating these components
- Extracted TokenManager from AuthClient for better separation of concerns
- Improved naming consistency throughout the codebase
- Created focused utility modules for reusable functionality

### Phase 2: DRY & KISS Principles
- Created reusable retry decorator in shared/utils/retry.py
- Standardized error handling for Redis operations
- Simplified email querying logic with extraction of common patterns
- Added Redis operation helpers for consistent initialization
- Removed magic numbers with named constants
- Implemented consistent error handling patterns
- Simplified token caching logic with a declarative approach

### Phase 3: SOLID Principles (Completed)
- Created interface definitions for core Email Service components:
  - `IEmailFetcher`
  - `IEmailNormalizer`
  - `IContentExtractor`
- Implemented concrete classes adhering to these interfaces:
  - `GmailApiClient` implements `IEmailFetcher`.
  - `EmailNormalizer` implements `IEmailNormalizer` and depends on `IContentExtractor`.
  - `EmailContentExtractor` implements `IContentExtractor`.
- Implemented the Strategy pattern for adaptive polling:
  - Defined `PollingStrategy` interface.
  - Created `FixedPollingStrategy` and `AdaptivePollingStrategy`.
  - `SyncStateManager` now depends on `PollingStrategy` interface.
- Verified changes with the full test suite (113 tests passed).

### Phase 4: Encapsulation & Side Effects (Completed)
- Redis client in `SyncStateManager` is now fully private (no public property or direct access).
- Methods with side effects in `SyncStateManager` are clearly named (e.g., `update_sync_metrics_in_redis`, `set_sync_status_in_redis`).
- `AuthClient` now separates pure cache retrieval (`get_user_token`) from side-effectful fetching (`get_and_cache_user_token`).
- All usages and tests updated to match the new API.
- Public API surfaces reviewed and minimized for all affected components.

## Current Tasks
With Phase 3 complete, we are now preparing for Phase 4: Encapsulation & Side Effects.

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 4: Encapsulation & Side Effects**
   - Review public API surfaces of all classes (especially refactored Email Service components).
   - Minimize exposure of implementation details (e.g., make Redis client private in `SyncStateManager`).
   - Clarify side effects in method names (e.g., in `SyncStateManager` and `AuthClient`).
   - Separate pure functions from those with side effects where appropriate.

2. Phase 5: Error Handling & Validation
   - Standardize error handling across all services
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Create custom exception hierarchy

In parallel, we need to continue development on:
- Classification Service
- Response Generation Service
- Draft Management Service

## Key Decisions & Preferences
1. We've decided to focus on refactoring the Email Service first, as it's the most critical and complex component
2. We're prioritizing test coverage for all refactored components
3. We're standardizing on a dependency injection approach for all services
4. We're creating clear interfaces to allow for multiple implementations where appropriate (Completed in Phase 3).
5. For error handling, we're adopting a structured approach with custom exceptions
6. We're standardizing on the Strategy pattern for variable behaviors (Implemented for polling in Phase 3).

## Project Insights
The code audit has revealed patterns that need addressing across the entire codebase:
1. Large classes with too many responsibilities
2. Inconsistent error handling approaches
3. Tight coupling between components
4. Duplicate code in similar operations
5. Side effects that aren't clearly communicated

Addressing these patterns systematically will not only improve the existing code but establish better practices for future development. We're seeing particular benefit from extracting common utilities and applying consistent patterns across services.
- SOLID principles provide a strong foundation for designing maintainable and testable software components.
- Interface Segregation leads to more focused and usable component APIs.
- Dependency Inversion significantly improves testability by allowing mock implementations.
- The Strategy pattern makes components like the polling mechanism extensible without modification.

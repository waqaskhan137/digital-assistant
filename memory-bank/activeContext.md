# Active Context

## Current Focus
We're currently focusing on improving the robustness and reliability of our authentication service, particularly around error handling, token management, and OAuth flows. Our recent work has centered on:

1. Standardizing error handling across all services
2. Fixing failing authentication service tests
3. Implementing comprehensive exception testing patterns
4. Enhancing OAuth security with proper state parameter validation

## Recent Changes

### Error Handling Standardization
We've implemented a centralized exception hierarchy in `shared/exceptions.py` that provides consistent error handling across all services. This includes:

- Base custom exception as the root of all custom exceptions
- Specific exception types for different error scenarios (ResourceNotFoundError, ValidationError, etc.)
- Standardized exception-to-HTTP response mapping in FastAPI handlers
- Rich context information in exception instances for better debugging

### Auth Service Test Fixes
We've fixed several failing tests in the auth service:

1. Fixed token storage tests that were failing due to incorrect mock configuration
2. Updated OAuth client tests to properly handle exception cases
3. Implemented proper cleanup in tests that were leaving state behind
4. Added tests for new exception handling patterns

### OAuth Security Enhancements
We've improved our OAuth implementation with several security enhancements:

1. Implemented state parameter validation to prevent CSRF attacks
2. Added comprehensive error handling for all OAuth failure modes
3. Improved token expiration management with proper refresh handling

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Auth Service Improvements**:
   - Finish implementing exception handlers in the auth service
   - Add comprehensive logging around authentication failures
   - Implement rate limiting for token requests to prevent abuse

2. **Extend Error Handling Pattern**:
   - Apply the standardized exception pattern to all remaining services
   - Update tests to use the new exception testing patterns
   - Add documentation for the error handling architecture

3. **Email Service Integration**:
   - Connect Email Service with Auth Service using the new token management system
   - Implement proper error handling for Gmail API client failures
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

4. **Testing Framework Improvements**:
   - Enhance test fixtures to support the new exception testing patterns
   - Add integration tests that verify correct error propagation between services
   - Implement test coverage reporting to identify gaps

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Error Handling Strategy
We've decided to use a centralized exception hierarchy rather than service-specific exceptions. This ensures consistency across services and simplifies API response generation. Key considerations:

- All exceptions inherit from a base custom exception
- Exceptions include rich context for debugging
- FastAPI exception handlers map exceptions to HTTP responses
- Services raise specific exception types rather than returning status codes

### Token Management Strategy
We're using Redis for token storage with a comprehensive token management approach:

- Tokens are stored with user_id as the key
- Automatic refresh mechanism for expired tokens
- Clear separation between token storage and OAuth client logic
- Proper error handling for token retrieval and refresh failures

### Testing Strategy
We've developed a comprehensive testing strategy for our authentication and error handling code:

- Unit tests for all components with proper mocking
- Integration tests that verify end-to-end flows
- Exception testing patterns to verify error handling
- Test fixtures that support common testing scenarios

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Structure
- Services follow a clear separation of concerns between routes, business logic, and data access
- Dependency injection is used for all external dependencies
- Configuration is loaded from environment variables with proper validation
- Interfaces define the contract for implementations

### Error Handling
- Use specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Include rich context in exceptions for debugging
- Let exceptions propagate to the appropriate handler
- Configure FastAPI exception handlers for consistent responses

### Testing
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests
- Use fixtures for common testing scenarios
- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify exception raising and handling

## Learnings and Insights

### Error Handling Complexity
We've learned that comprehensive error handling is more complex than initially anticipated. Key insights:

- Different external services (Gmail API, OAuth providers) have varied error responses
- Mapping external errors to our internal exception hierarchy requires careful consideration
- Exception context needs to be rich enough for debugging but sanitized for API responses
- Consistent error handling across services requires disciplined implementation

### OAuth Security Considerations
Our work on OAuth security has highlighted several important considerations:

- State parameter validation is essential for preventing CSRF attacks
- Token refresh logic needs robust error handling
- Error responses from OAuth providers can be inconsistent
- Secure storage of tokens requires careful implementation

### Testing Challenges
We've encountered several challenges in testing our authentication code:

- Mocking Redis and OAuth providers requires careful setup
- Testing exception paths requires specific testing patterns
- Integration tests need proper cleanup to avoid state leakage
- Test fixtures need to be flexible enough to support different scenarios

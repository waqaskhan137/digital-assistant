# Project Brief: Automated Gmail Categorization and Response Microservice

## 1. Executive Summary
This microservice will authenticate with a user's Gmail account via OAuth 2.0 web flow, ingest incoming emails in real time, categorize and label them automatically, and generate draft responses for those requiring a reply using a generative AI model (e.g., OpenAI GPT or Google Gemini). By deconstructing the problem from first principles—authentication, ingestion, classification, response generation, and draft management—we define a modular, scalable, and secure architecture that can be iterated on before implementation.

## 2. Objectives
- **Secure Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 web authorization to access Gmail.
- **Email Ingestion**: Stream or poll incoming emails reliably.
- **Categorization & Labeling**: Classify emails into folders/labels (e.g., important, spam, support, personal) using rule-based and ML-based classifiers.
- **Response Generation**: Identify emails needing replies and draft responses via a GenAI API.
- **Draft Management**: Save generated replies as drafts in the user’s Gmail account for review.
- **Extensibility**: Architect for multiple email providers and custom model integrations.

## 3. Scope & Deliverables
- OAuth 2.0 authentication module (frontend and backend).
- Email ingestion pipeline (push notifications via Gmail API or polling).
- Classification engine: initial rule-based filters plus customizable ML component.
- Integration with generative AI service for response drafting.
- Draft-saving mechanism using Gmail Drafts API.
- Monitoring, logging, and error-handling framework.

## 4. First-Principles Decomposition
1. **Authentication**: At the core, any access to user resources requires secure, user-consented tokens—OAuth 2.0 provides this foundation.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Emails are data units; we need a reliable mechanism (webhooks vs. polling) to bring them into the system.
3. **Classification**: To decide action per email, we distill email content into features (sender, subject, body) and apply simple heuristics or trainable models.
4. **Decision Logic**: A binary decision: "needs reply?" based on classification output plus customizable rules.
5. **Response Synthesis**: Leverage pretrained LLMs to construct context-aware, polite drafts.
6. **Persistence & UX**: Place drafts back into Gmail, enabling the user to review, edit, and send.

```

- **Auth Service**: Handles OAuth consent, token refresh, and secure storage.
- **Email Ingestion**: Subscribes to Gmail push notifications or polls for new messages.
- **Classifier**: Rule-based filters (regex, sender whitelist/blacklist) combined with ML models for topic detection.
- **Labeler**: Applies labels via Gmail API.
- **Response Engine**: Calls external GenAI API, passing email context and prompt template.
- **Draft Creator**: Uses Gmail Drafts endpoint to save generated replies.
- **User Agent**: Web UI or CLI for setup, monitoring, and manual override.

## 6. Technology Stack
- **Language & Framework**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express).
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with Google APIs.
- **Queue**: Cloud Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ for ingestion events.
- **Classification**: scikit-learn / TensorFlow or a lightweight rules engine.
- **GenAI Integration**: OpenAI SDK or Google Cloud AI client.
- **Persistence**: Redis for token/session caching; optional DB (PostgreSQL) for audit logs.
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, Kubernetes or serverless functions.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana, with error alerts via Slack/email.

## 7. Risks & Considerations
- **Token Expiry**: Need robust refresh logic.
- **Quota Limits**: Gmail API and GenAI rate limits.
- **Privacy & Compliance**: Ensure user data is encrypted and stored minimally.
- **Model Hallucinations**: Validate drafts before sending.

## 8. Next Steps
1. Validate user flows: OAuth consent and token exchange.
2. Prototype email ingestion and labeling rules.
3. Experiment with GenAI prompt templates for draft quality.
4. Define success metrics (accuracy of classification, quality of responses).
5. Plan a minimal MVP release and gather user feedback.
